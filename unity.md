- NOTE: I got a build error saying that it couldn't copy the .apk to my phone, and to check the SDK installation. It said that the "app signature" was different from the version on my phone (this is probably due to the phone version being deployed from my laptop versus this new one from my desktop). To fix this, simply uninstall the phone version from phone and then re-build and run.
