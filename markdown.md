- _ITALIC_: surrounded by _ or *

- **BOLD**: surrounded by **

- escape these special characters using the standard '\'
- can wrap combos of these characters

- HEADERS: six sizes, prefixed by a number of '#'

#header one
##header two
###header three
####header four
#####header five
######header six

- can't really make a header bold, but can italicize certain words

- LINKS: 
- AUTOMATIC LINK: surrounded by <>
- INLINE LINK: syntax = \[link text](URL)
- can make the link text italic, bold, etc. (place special chars inside the [])
- can make part of a header a link aswell.
- REFERENCE LINK: references another place in document
- ex.
- here's a link [link text][google]

[google]: www.google.com

- note: its necessary that some special elements are preceeded by an empty line (such as links/headers)

- IMAGES: similar to links
- INLINE IMAGE LINK: prefix an INLINE LINK with '!', the link text is instead 'alt text'
- REFERENCE IMAGE: prefix a REFERENCE LINK with '!'

- BLOCKQUOTES:
- make an area of text stand out
- prefix any line with '>'
- can use other special elements inside blockquotes as well

- LISTS:
- UNORDERED LIST: prefix each item with '* ' and put on new line
- ORDERED LISTS: prefix each item with '1. ', '2. ', etc. on new lines
- NESTED LISTS: indent the prefixes at different levels
- PARAGRAPHS: ex.

1. Cut the cheese
  
 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes
 
 Be careful when holding the knife.
 
 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

- PARAGRAPHS:
- we HARD BREAK LINES by inserting a blank line between sentences.
- we SOFT BREAK LINES by inserting 2 spaces at the end of each line 
- ex.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
